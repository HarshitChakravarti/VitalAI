## Feature Highlights

### Indian Cuisine Recipe Engine

The Indian cuisine feature showcases authentic recipes with proper regional classification and spice level indicators. The integration with Google's Gemini API enables:

- Region-specific recipes (North, South, East, West, Central Indian)
- Spice level customization (Mild üå∂Ô∏è, Medium üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è, Hot üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è)
- Detailed nutritional breakdown with macros
- Dietary preference filtering (vegetarian, vegan, keto, etc.)
- Step-by-step instructions with ingredient lists

The recipe system includes a robust fallback mechanism that serves curated content when API services are unavailable, ensuring users always have access to quality recipes.

### Predictive Health Analysis

The platform's predictive health analysis module evaluates various health markers to identify potential risks before they become problematic:

- Diabetes risk assessment based on lifestyle factors and metrics
- Cardiovascular health analysis with personalized recommendations
- Mental health monitoring with stress and sleep quality insights
- Skin condition analysis through visual pattern recognition
- Allergy risk evaluation based on environmental and genetic factors

Each analysis module provides actionable insights rather than just raw data, helping users make meaningful lifestyle adjustments.

## Project Structure

The application follows a modular architecture for maintainability and scalability:

- `/src/components` - UI components organized by feature
- `/src/app` - Next.js app router pages and API routes
- `/src/lib` - Shared utilities, services, and API clients
- `/src/contexts` - React context providers for state management
- `/src/data` - Static data and fallback content
- `/src/styles` - Global styles and theme configuration
- `/supabase` - Database schema and migration scripts

## API Integration

### Google Gemini API

Used for generating personalized recipe suggestions and health insights. Set up your API key in the `.env.local` file:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Workout Database (RapidAPI)

Provides exercise information and workout plans. Configure in `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Troubleshooting

### API Connection Issues

If you experience problems with the Gemini API:

1. Verify your API key is correctly set in `.env.local`
2. Check your API quota and usage limits
3. Test the connection using the diagnostic tools in `/src/lib/api/gemini-test.ts`
